      # Note: This requires a custom validation webhook that runs Trivy
      # For a complete implementation, you would need:
      # 1. A validation webhook service that scans images
      # 2. Integration with Trivy or similar scanner
      # 3. Caching to avoid re-scanning the same image
      # This is a placeholder showing the policy structure
